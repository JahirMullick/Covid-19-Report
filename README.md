# COVID-19 Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the data engineering aspects of handling COVID-19 data, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset for analysis and research. The dataset aggregates information from various reliable sources, including health agencies, international organizations, and official APIs, to create a holistic view of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Source
The original dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report/). Ensure you abide by Kaggle's terms and conditions for usage.

## Data Description
- **File Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or other relevant formats.
- **Data Fields**: The dataset includes a wide range of fields such as date, location, confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, and more.

## Data Engineering Process

### Transformations
The COVID-19 dataset undergoes various transformations to ensure its quality and usability:
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing or erroneous data points.
- **Data Enrichment**: Include additional relevant information if necessary.
- **Aggregation**: Aggregate data for specific analyses if required.
- **Normalization**: Standardizing data format and encoding for consistency.

### Loading
The transformed COVID-19 dataset is loaded into a designated data storage solution, ensuring scalability and efficient data retrieval.
